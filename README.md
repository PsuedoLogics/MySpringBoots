Simple message submission in Java using Gradle, Springboot, Thymeleaf to display an HTML input form on the local network and display whatever message is input. 

To run download files. Open in intelliJ.

Make sure correct version of Java is set in build.gradle file. 

Java version change from (17) to (22) for me(If necessary).
